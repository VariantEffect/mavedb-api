# ARQ Worker Jobs Developer Documentation

This documentation provides an overview and detailed guidance for developers working with the ARQ worker jobs, decorators, and managers in the MaveDB API codebase. It is organized into the following sections:

- [Job System Overview](jobs_overview.md)
- [Job Decorators](job_decorators.md)
- [Job Managers](job_managers.md)
- [Pipeline Management](pipeline_management.md)
- [Job Registry and Configuration](job_registry.md)
- [Best Practices & Patterns](best_practices.md)

Each section is a separate markdown file for clarity and maintainability. Start with `jobs_overview.md` for a high-level understanding, then refer to the other files for implementation details and usage patterns.
